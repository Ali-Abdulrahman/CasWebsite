& her love, Sarah, at Brooklyn House Hotel
‍
I’m just a hurricane eye,
They’re not a little too shy,
Know how I wanted to sing,
Know how they wanted to sing

Don’t you understand?
Don’t you know
The love that you want’s all the love that you needed?
Gave me all you had,
Gave me all the love that you want,
All the love that you needed

Baby blue movie with always for tuesdays
& her new bestie, perfectly sweet...

Don’t you understand?
Don’t you know
The love that you want’s gonna make it feel sweeter?
Gave me all you had,
Gave me all the love that you want,
All the love that you needed</pre>
