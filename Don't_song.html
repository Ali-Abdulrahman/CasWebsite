          <pre class="lyrics">When I was young I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded & I never saw you again,
But I won’t forget the love we had

Come to me now,
Don’t let me go
Stay by my side

Don’t let me go
Stay with me still
I’ve missed you so

When I was young I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
& though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared…

& my heart goes out to you wherever you are…</pre>
