          <pre class="lyrics">Baby, it’s been awhile since I’ve just seen you smile
You know it’s not how it’s supposed to be
You’re staying up every night smoking those Camel lights
& drinking on antihistamines

Do you wanna make it forever?
Do you wanna be my only one?
Because now I really miss the way it was
When everything was beautiful with us

I think of us moving into our place at Bunker Hill,
We felt so happy there
The time we went for a walk to get wine & candy bars
& it started to rain…

Do you wanna make it forever?
Do you want me to stay right here?
Do you wanna make it forever?
If you want, I would stay right here…</pre>
