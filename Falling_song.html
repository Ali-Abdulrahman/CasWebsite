          <pre class="lyrics">When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
& last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, “all that I want is to be yours”

Falling in love,
Falling in love
Deeper than I’ve felt it before with you, baby
I feel I’m falling in love with all my heart

Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
& you were imagining sitting next to me
& holding my hand for the whole thing…</pre>
