          <pre class="lyrics">There was a hentai video that I saw
I told you about the night that we first made love
About a girl, who as soon as she made you come
Could show you the future & tell you your fortune

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I’ve been waiting for you to fall for me & let me in your life
I’ve been waiting for you

Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash over the ocean
That it was romantic, but you didn’t like it
Thought it was stupid & thinking of me dead was making you feel bad…</pre>
