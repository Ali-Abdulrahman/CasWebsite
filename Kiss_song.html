          <pre class="lyrics">Saw you on the side of the road
I could see you were walking slow, drinking a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap, falling in my lap
You were so thirsty

Could you love me instead of all the boyfriends you get?
Know I’d make you forget about all of those rich fuckboys

Kiss it off me,
If you’re gonna break my heart this is a good start
Kiss it off me

You always bite your lip when you’re feeling it, as we move slowly
& your peach baseball cap is tossed under the rack of clothes
& your jewelry

& you beg for it in the morning again before you go to the gym
Said it’s a bad habit you just can’t quit…</pre>
