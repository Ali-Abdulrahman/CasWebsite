          <pre class="lyrics">We wanted to fuck with real love
Wanted it sweet, so pure & warm
Never only sleeping over

We wanted to fuck like all the time
& when you got back from your flight
It was the first thing we did

& when you say you want it all
I know you want it all
Baby, take it all from me
& when you drag me on the floor & the blue tejano’s on,
You keep your eyes on me

So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
Get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever

In shorts so high waist,
The girl in the arcade said they were the shortest ever
& the rest like “Holiday”,
The live one where she sang, dancing in a polka dot top...

So get in the waves, swim in your leather
I always will make it feel like you were the last one
Get in the waves like it was the first time
Bless your heart, make you part of my life forever & always...</pre>
