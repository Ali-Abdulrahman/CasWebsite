          <pre class="lyrics">I missed you & I cried, but I said that I was alright
& I know it’s been awhile since I needed a distraction

Because I want to do everything that you want me to
To tell you the truth

I need to stay alive, so sad that I could die

It’s leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely because it’s not enough
Missing you only ever since we fell in love

& I watched you do a line that you spread out on the table
I don’t need to see you wired, I just want to see you upside down

I want to do everything that you want me to
To tell you the truth

I listened to you cry all night through the telephone…

Couldn’t say you didn’t want me then when we were lying in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person as if suddenly you wanted to just be friends
I was hurt & so I took a shower so you couldn’t hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking you were sleeping or just faking…</pre>
