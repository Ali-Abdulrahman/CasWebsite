          <pre class="lyrics">Do it with the lips that you kept when I finally kissed you
When every single light in the Hills & the Valley went blue
Make love as soft as cinnamon,
Know when to take & when to give
Running out of bed in your leopard print to unlock the door

Sleeping on your fingertips, dreaming with a filthy heart
Deep within a threesome-kiss, sweet how the words slip
Honest with the love you give, careless with the way you talk
Say you want it just like this, sweet how the words slip

Do it with the lips that you kept when I said I was yours
With X’s on the prints, they’re of Marilyn by Bert Stern
Lit candles, pink & yellow cake, let’s get fucked up & celebrate
Rolling out of bed in your tangled hair to put some clothes on…</pre>
