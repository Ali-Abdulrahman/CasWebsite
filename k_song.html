          <pre class="lyrics">I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached,
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

& on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
& I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me & no one else...
& I'm kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
& it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me
I don't want you to leave...</pre>
