          <pre class="lyrics">Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile & look away

Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side

When we dance in my living room
To that silly '90s R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene

When we're laughing in the microphone & singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs</pre>
