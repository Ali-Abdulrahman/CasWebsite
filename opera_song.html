          <pre class="lyrics">Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
& I walked across its stage singing with my eyes closed

I’ve got a love for you I just can’t escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

I was meant to love you & always keep you in my life
I was meant to love you,
I knew I loved you at first sight

If I abandoned love I’d be a man without dreams
I’d rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now

& I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

I was meant to love you & always keep you in my life
I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight</pre>
