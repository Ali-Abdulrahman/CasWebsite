          <pre class="lyrics">Sitting out smoking in the garden of the apartment
I reached in to grab your hand & kissed it when you weren’t looking

You’re on the sheets like it’s a dirty magazine
& I like the way you say exactly what you mean

Truly,
Know that you really don’t need to be in love to make love to me

Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there

& your lips were red in all the pictures that you sent
Wearing white or black,
All leading up to when we met…</pre>
