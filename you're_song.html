          <pre class="lyrics">You would use your songs to say the words you couldn’t say
& every word you sang was about you & me

I loved everything you wrote
& when you would sing I felt that my heart was falling

You’re all I want
We fucked so hot it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love, it’s only yours
You’re all I want, all I love

& with Cristal & pink champagne,
On our wedding day you had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us

Then you got on top of it & you sang to me as the snow was falling…</pre>
