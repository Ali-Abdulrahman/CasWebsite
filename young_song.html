          <pre class="lyrics">Wearing black lipstick, bleaching your hair blonde
Put on your socks, cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs & your I Love New York shirt

Well I know full well that you are the patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you’re a cheater
Well so am I

You wanna go where the girls are young & dumb & hot as fuck
Where they’re dancing in the street with nothing on

We’ll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat you showed me
We’ll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat, oh baby

My heart is racing watching you kissing on my guitar
Faking a tear drop by spraying my eye with that water gun…

We wanna go where the girls are young & dumb & hot as fuck
Where they’re dancing in the street with nothing on…</pre>
