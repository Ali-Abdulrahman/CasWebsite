          <pre class="lyrics">You only fuck for love
Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You could be my Penthouse Pet, I know

You make me think of storms on the beaches
With all the lights off

Everything is wrong, but it’s alright
You’re the only good thing in my life

Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
Shouldn’t have a care left in the world
Naked, tanning by the swimming pool…

Laying in the sun,
Never need to tell me when you come
Because you know that I can just feel it</pre>
